### API Functions

Describe the function and the parameters to each function.

### Feature List 

- a fully interactive webpage which the user can modify chart data (add/remove values), adjust various chart options and see the changes reflected in the chart display on the bottom of the page in real time.

### Known Bugs

- labels cannot handle more than one word

### Roadmap

Unfinished features:

- addressing known bugs
- the ability to have multiple bars per label
- CSS annimations for the chart
- JQuery effects (such as: when hovering over a bar, coloring it a different color from the rest of the bars, etc, etc).
- the requirement for being a 'library' isn't fully met (due to the fact that I initially prioritized my code for my demo page, in order to get live feedback). I had planned to convert fully to a library as per the project requirements later, but ran out of time prior to bootcamp starting.  This is my first HTML webpage, so I wanted to be able to focus on building a real webpage, and also be able to see the changes I made to the code in real time.
